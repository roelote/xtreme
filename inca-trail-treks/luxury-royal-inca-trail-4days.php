                <p>We will leave Cusco by private bus at 5.30am. Before reaching our starting point km 82, we will make a stop at Ollantaytambo for breakfast. Namely, km 82 is the name for the official starting point of the Inca Trail. We will follow the Sacred Valley of the Incas to this point, where we will meet the rest of the team (porters, cooks ...). The trek will start with a suspension bridge that crosses the Urubamba River at an altitude of 2600 meters. The first day of the trek, the walk will be rather easy and will be a good warm-up for the following days. After a short walk, we will discover the first archaeological site of the trek: Llactapata, agricultural center with large terraces Incas. We will take this opportunity to have our first meal, before continuing our walk. We will go up the river Cusichaca to the village of Wayllabamba (3000 meters of altitude), then we will join Yuncachimpa (3300 meters), where we will spend our first night in camp. From this place, we will have the opportunity to enjoy a magnificent view of the mysterious Nevado de Verónica.</p>

                <p>The second day is a day with high altitude, it means that everyone will have to climb at his own pace, of course this day will consist of many breaks. Early in the morning we will walk through the Llulluchapampa Valley (3850m). The first 3 kilometers, you will appreciate the wooded and humid region, rocked by the sound of the water. The trail will climb slightly through beautiful subtropical vegetation. The slope will then become steeper and the forests will gradually give way to bare landscapes of the "puna" altitude. We will climb painfully to the Warmiwañusca Pass (4200 meters, the "Pass of the Dead Woman" in Quechua). </p>

                <p>This climb is known as the most grueling of all the Inca Trail. After a short break, we will descend to the other side, up to the Pacaymayo River Valley (3500 meters), before starting to climb again to the archaeological site of Runkurakay (3950 meters). Perched on a rocky outcrop, this site served as a watchtower and tambo (relay) to the Chasquis (the Inca messengers). We continue the climb to the second pass, 3950 meters above sea level, before descending to the ruin of Sayacmarca (3600 meters), a small city composed of a labyrinth of alleyways, squares, houses, terraces, fountains, etc. . We will quickly reach the site of our second camp, in Chaquicocha, 3650 meters above sea level and we will enjoy an impressive view of the mountains.

                  <ul class="list-unstyled pl-4">
                    <li><b>(1) Visit to Huayna Picchu or Montaña:</b> To climb the Huayna Picchu or Montaña, this requires a good time in advance. We take care of the reservation and guarantee your entrance for Huayna Picchu or Montaña. With of course an additional fee of $ 65.00, in addition to the entrance to Machu Picchu and the Inca Trail, according to the regulation of the Ministry of Culture. (This new law came into force on July 18, 2011).</li>
                    <li><b>(2) Additional Carrier:</b> According to the Law (26702) of the Ministry of Employment, the cooperation of an additional porter is given under the conditions that the customer requires. However, the customer's luggage must not exceed 12 kg. The service costs USD 130, and includes transportation, entrance to the Inca Trail, food and camping equipment.</li>
                    <li><b>(3) Gratuities:</b> for porters, cooks and guides are always welcome. Carriers are also very grateful for a small donation, such as school clothes or materials for their children.</li>
                    <li><b>(4) Camping sites :</b> Camping sites on the Inka Trail may vary from those described in our itinerary (Yuncachimpa, Chaquicocha and Wiñaywayna). This is the consequence of a limitation of places (Wiñaywayna is almost always complete). The camping sites (especially the Wiñaywayna site) are known to the general public. This is why we reserve the seats well in advance (if you want to go during the high season, that is to say from May to September, it is important to book a few months in advance). If there is no more room, the Ministry of Culture (government entity that observes and controls the availability of participation for the Inka Path) will grant other camping sites (Wayllabamba, Pacaymayo and Phuyupatamarcka ).</li>
                    <li><b>(5) Student Card :</b> To be eligible for the $ 20.00 student discount, you must have a valid ISIC student card when booking - not just when you arrive in Cusco! The validity must correspond to the whole year in progress. When booking, we will need a copy of your card. The Ministry of Culture is strict when regulating student cards.</li>
                    <li><b>(6) CANCELLATION:</b> For any last minute cancellation, the expenses already made by the agency will be at your expense.</li>
