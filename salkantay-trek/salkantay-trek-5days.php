                </ul>
                <p><b>Optional:</b> After having lunch in Soraypampa, we strongly recommend hiking to Laguna de Humantay where you are able to discover the beautiful view of Humantay Lake and Humantay snow-covered.</p>

                <h3>Day 2: Soraypampa - Salkantay pass – Rayanpata (Andenes)</h3>
                <img src="../img/tours/salkantay-trek-rayanpata-campsite.jpg" alt="machu picchu" class="img-thumbnail float-left mx-2 mr-3" width="300">
                <p>After breakfast we will set off towards the Salkantay Pass (4600m/15092f) which offers an exceptional view of the Salkantay snow-capped (6264m). Thereafter we will descend again and will have time to enjoy the increasing vegetation of the ecosystem. Our campsite will be in Rayanpata (3350m/10990ft), amidst the tropical forest.</p>

                
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Climate:</b> cold and warm with mosquitoes</li>
                  <li><b>hiking time:</b> 7-8 hours</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="clearfix"></div>
                <h3>Day 3: Rayanpata (Andenes) – Chaullay - Wiñaypoco - Lucmabamba</h3>
                <img src="../img/tours/salkantay-trek-lucmabamba-campsite.jpg" alt="machu picchu" class="img-thumbnail float-left mx-2" width="300">
                <p>The third day is dedicated to the region’s flora and its plantations. After descending to a dimmed forest and enjoying the diversity of species of orchids, bromeliads and many other plants, we will see coffee-, cacao- and fruit-plantations. Moreover, we will have the pleasure to meet local families of Chaullay (2950m/9678ft) Wiñaypoco (2650m/8694f), La Playa (2100m/6890f) and Lucmabamba (2000m/6561ft). Our campsite will be in Lucmabamba.</p>

                 <p>This afternoon you stay in contact with a local rural family from the forest in which you will have the opportunity to witness the cultivation and processing of coffee.
                    Depending on the variety, it takes approximately 3 to 4 years for newly planted coffee trees to begin to bear fruit. </p>

                  <p>The fruit, called the coffee cherry, turns a bright, deep red when it is ripe and ready to be harvested. Due to the botanical characteristics of the coffee tree and the fact that coffee is often grown in mountainous areas, widespread use of mechanical harvesters is not possible and the ripe coffee cherries are usually picked by hand, a labour-intensive and difficult process. We will show and explain to you the complete process from the tree to the cup of coffee. You will also have the opportunity to ask the locals your own questions about the process of cultivation.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><b>Climate: </b>warm during the day with mosquitoes</li>
                  <li><b>Hiking time:</b> 7 hours</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Optional:</b> After arduous hiking days we suggest to be relaxed at the hot mineral spring of Santa Teresa then it must be coordinated with your tour guide to be arranged a vehicle from Lucmabamba to Santa Teresa.</p>

                <h3>Day 4: Lucmabamba - Llactapata Inca site – Machu Picchu town</h3>
